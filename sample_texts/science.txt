Quantum physics explores the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales. Unlike classical physics, quantum mechanics reveals that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a phenomenon known as superposition. This principle is fundamental to understanding how quantum computers work.

Artificial intelligence represents one of the most significant technological advances of our time. Machine learning algorithms can now recognize patterns, make predictions, and even generate creative content. Deep learning, a subset of AI, uses neural networks inspired by the human brain to solve complex problems.

Climate science studies the Earth's climate system and how it changes over time. Researchers analyze temperature data, ice core samples, and atmospheric conditions to understand global warming patterns. This scientific field is crucial for predicting future climate scenarios and developing mitigation strategies.
